# Price-Monitoring-App
Online shopping can be a tricky process for those who visit e-commerce websites frequently and wish to buy products with their lowest prices. Finding cheapest price for a product needs visiting e-commerce websites frequently. E-commerce websites know and use it to make the products more affordable. In this project, we developed an application to make this process more convenient and less time-consuming process. Thanks to our application, users are able to monitor product prices on different e-commerce websites in one place. Our application also gives a product recommendation to users when a new product is added. 

To develop this application, we first implemented a crawling module to fetch product price, image, and title. We used Firebase to store users' products and recommended products and authenticate user credentials. The recommendation module was implemented using TF-IDF Vectorizer and Cosine similarity metric.  In the backend side, Node.js was used to serve the application. We built the UI components in React and the application was lastly deployed to Heroku cloud platform.
